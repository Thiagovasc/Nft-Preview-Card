## My process

I started to analyze what the challenge asked for in order to be able to divide this big problem into smaller ones like creating variables for the main colors and neutral tones and I continued until I developed a satisfactory solution with my real knowledge in this area


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

i learned a lot about css units, i used to just use px but now i see the importance of other units, this challenge was very important for flexbox practice, content splitting and active states

### Continued development

i still an active state to complete, i managed to find solutions for such problem on youtube and github but i don't want to copy code but develop my own solution when i'm able to do so
